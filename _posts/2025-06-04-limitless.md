## The Book in 3 Sentences

1. Becoming limitless takes small steps done consistently.
2. Most limits are mental. Change your process and you change your results.
3. You need a strong why and to fuel your brain the right way.

## First Thoughts

I expected another basic self-help book about habits or motivation. But this one went deeper. It gave real steps, solid techniques, and kept reminding me that just knowing stuff doesn’t matter unless you actually use it.

## Who Should Read This

Anyone who feels like their brain isn’t working at its best. If you get overwhelmed with learning, struggle to focus, or feel like you're capable of more, this book can help you be more aware of what you're dealing and provides information on how to work on it. 

## How It Changed Me

* Made me realize how bad habits were affecting my focus and mental energy.
* Helped me understand what to do in the moment when I'm stuck or stressed.
* Showed me how to reframe my thoughts and build better learning systems.


## Big Ideas and Takeaways

### The Limitless Model

* **Mindset**: Believe you can learn and grow.
* **Motivation**: Know why you're doing it.
* **Method**: Learn how to learn better.

### Digital Overload

We rely too much on tech to think for us. This weakens our memory and attention span. You have to practice remembering things yourself and filtering information.

### The FASTER Method

Forget what you already know. Act on what you learn. Manage your emotional state. Learn with the goal of teaching it. Schedule time to practice. Review regularly.

### Spaced Repetition and the Forgetting Curve

The forgetting curve shows how quickly we lose information if we don’t review it. Right after learning something, your memory of it drops fast. But if you review the material at spaced intervals (1 day, 3 days, 6 days, etc.), your brain retains more of it over time.

That’s why spaced repetition works. It forces your brain to recall something just before you’re about to forget it, which strengthens the memory.

![Forgetting Curve with Reviews](forget.webp)

Use a system like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) or just set a reminder to revisit your notes after 1, 3, and 6 days. Each time you review, your retention curve flattens out. 
> fun fact, I HEAVILY used Anki cards to study for my CCNA exam. Highly recommend them.
{: .prompt-tip } 

### Pomodoro Technique and Focus

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple time management tool. You set a timer for 25 minutes and work with zero distractions. Then you take a 5-minute break. After 4 sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break.

This works because attention drops fast over time. Most people start strong, lose focus in the middle, then regain a bit toward the end.

![Primacy and Recency Effect](curve.webp)

Using short focused study sessions with breaks takes advantage of the primacy and recency effects, you remember the beginning and end of a session more than the middle. So by breaking work into chunks, you maximize the good parts and avoid the mental dip in the middle.

Try this with studying or reading. Combine Pomodoro with spaced repetition and you’ll get way more out of your learning sessions.

### Breaking Mental Limits

Call out your negative self-talk and replace it with better beliefs. Act like a thermostat, not a thermometer. Set your own standards.

### Motivation = Purpose x Energy x Small Steps

You don’t need big energy all the time. You just need to stay aligned with your purpose, take care of your body, and take one step at a time.

### Brain Fuel

* Sleep is non-negotiable
* Kill negative self-talk
* Eat real food
* Exercise
* Clean air and a clean space
* Hang around the right people
* Keep learning new stuff

### Study Smarter

* Active recall + spaced repetition works best
* Set your physical and mental state before studying
* Use music, smells, and your own words to remember better
* Take real breaks

### Speed Reading

Use your finger to guide your eyes. Read with focus and keep practicing. Don’t read slow just to feel safe. Faster reading actually helps you stay focused and remember more (which made no sense to me at first but I swear it actually works).

## Final Thoughts

Limitless is a how-to manual for unlocking your brain. It’s not about being perfect or superhuman. It’s about getting intentional and taking action. You already have what you need, you just have to stop getting in your own way.

Good book. Solid takeaways. Worth reading if you're trying to get sharper, learn faster, and build better habits without burning out.

That’s it.
