 <h2>About This Project</h2>
<p><strong>So why AI music?</strong><br>
 I'm a cybersecurity student who genuinely loves music but cannot sing to save my life. Seriously, lol. But I've got all this knowledge about security stuff that I want to share in ways that actually stick with people. Let's be honest, cybersecurity topics can be pretty dry sometimes, so I figured why not try something different and combine two things I care about?</p>

<p><strong>What I'm doing here</strong><br>
 I'm taking real cybersecurity incidents and turning them into stories through music. Those romance scams that cost people their life savings? Fake boss emails that empty company accounts? The chaos after a major ransomware hit? This stuff happens every day, and I want people to recognize these patterns. I take inspiration from storytellers like J. Cole who can break down stories in ways and flows that just click. That approach works because it makes complicated topics feel more human.</p>

<p><strong>The AI part</strong><br>
 I use AI for the vocals. I write every word and do all the research. I'm not trying to replace real musicians. I'm just using whatever tools I can to get important information out there through something people already connect with. Plus, it's honestly just fun. What better way to really understand a topic than turning your research into actual lyrics and hearing it come to life?</p>

<p><strong>Just to be clear</strong><br>
 I'm not making any money from this or getting paid by anyone. This is purely something I do because I'm passionate about cybersecurity and love experimenting with different ways to share what I learn. It's a passion project that combines two things I care about.</p>

<p><strong>The whole point</strong><br>
 Every story in these songs comes from real cases with real people and real consequences. If even one person hears these tracks and learns something, then this whole thing was worth doing.</p>
