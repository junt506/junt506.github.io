  <h2> About This Project</h2>
  <p><strong>Real talk - why AI music?</strong><br>
  Look, I'm a cybersecurity student who loves music and has zero ability to sing. Like, seriously - I couldn't carry a tune if my life depended on it. But I've got all this knowledge about things I want to share in ways that are different, and to be honest? Sometimes learning about security topics can make you zone off.
  So I thought, why not combine the two things I'm passionate about and see what happens?</p>

  <p><strong>What I'm trying to do here</strong><br>
  I'm taking real cybersecurity stuff and turning them into stories that hopefully stick in your head. Those romance scams hitting people for hundreds of thousands? The fake boss emails draining company accounts? The aftermath of a huge ransomware attack? This stuff is everywhere, and I want people to recognize it in a different way.
  Some of the beats and flows are inspired by artists like J. Cole because I love his storytelling and the depth in his words, but he puts it simply. That storytelling approach just works - it makes complex topics feel more relatable.</p>

  <p><strong>About the AI thing</strong><br>
  Yeah, the vocals are AI-generated by Suno AI. I write every lyric, do all the research, craft the stories - but when it comes to actually delivering them? That's where AI steps in to handle what I straight up cannot do.
  I'm not trying to replace real artists. I'm just using the tools available to get important information out there through something everyone already loves - music. If AI can help me turn cybersecurity into something people actually want to listen to and it sounds good? I'm all for it. Also, I do it because it's literally just fun. What more fun  way to solidify your understanding of a researched topic than by making literal lyrics out of it and having people hear it? It's just so awesome.</p>

  <p><strong>The point of all this</strong><br>
  Every story in these songs comes from real cases - real people, real companies, real tactics, real research. If one person hears these tracks and recognizes or learns one thing, then this whole project is worth it.</p>
