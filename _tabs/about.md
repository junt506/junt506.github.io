      I'm Jeremy, but online I go by <span class="highlight">qewave</span>. This website is my personal playground and documentation hub. If you're looking for my more professional side, click the LinkedIn icon in the bottom left on this site. Here, I post my CTF writeups, hacking stuff, reverse engineering notes, random tech rants, and other things I find useful or worth sharing.

    <blockquote>
      I’ve been into hacking since I was 16. I started out by modifying games to unlock unreleased skins just to flex. In high school, I never really knew what career path I wanted. The funny part is  I was always talking about tech, coding, or software projects without realizing that this was what I was meant to do. It finally clicked senior year.
      <br/><br/>
      Since then, I’ve earned my associate's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Networking & Security, and I’m continuing coursework in the same field. I'm planning to pursue a bachelor's degree in either Cloud or Cybersecurity.
      <br/><br/>
      I’ve attended nearly every major security event and conference in California, helped found the first Cybersecurity Club at my college (and became its representative), secured a SysOps/Security internship, won a few CTFs, picked up some certs like <span class="badge">Security+</span> and <span class="badge">CCNA</span>, and built tons of personal labs and projects.
      <br/><br/>
      I’m not a genius, but I love figuring things out. Especially in security, that constant mystery combined with a cat and mouse game is what keeps me on my toes. That’s why I’ve been obsessed with <span class="highlight">malware analysis</span> and <span class="highlight">reverse engineering</span>. Do I know what I’m looking at right away? Hell no. But do I love digging into it until it clicks and I find what I need? Absolutely.
